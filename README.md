# semantic-html-tags
Project: A static web page built by me to showcase semantic html tags. 

Goal: To showcase my current ailities in front-end web development.
 To complete a codeacademy project, I had to create a cheat sheet of sorts on a html topic I was comfortable with. 

About: The webpage includes some if not all the semantic elements in html and their descriptions. I have tried to make a static blog style front-end following and adhering to the standard industry-wide practices as best as i could; using simple html and css
